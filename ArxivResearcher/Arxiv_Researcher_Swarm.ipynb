    "## AutoGen Swarm\n",
    "Swarm implements a team in which agents can hand off task to other agents based on their capabilities. It is a multi-agent design pattern first introduced by OpenAI in an experimental project. The key idea is to let agent delegate tasks to other agents using a special tool call, while all agents share the same message context. This enables agents to make local decisions about task planning, rather than relying on a central orchestrator such as in SelectorGroupChat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speaker agent is selected based on the most recent HandoffMessage message in the context. This naturally requires each agent in the team to be able to generate HandoffMessage to signal which other agents that it hands off to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this is how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each agent has the ability to generate HandoffMessage to signal which other agents it can hand off to. For AssistantAgent, this means setting the handoffs argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When the team starts on a task, the first speaker agents operate on the task and make locallized decision about whether to hand off and to whom.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When an agent generates a HandoffMessage, the receiving agent takes over the task with the same message context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The process continues until a termination condition is met."

The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene Com-\\npletion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level information,\\nthereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding. While PSC was\\nintroduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images remain largely\\nunexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches utilize a fixed set\\nof learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene volume. Although these\\nqueries are typically updated with image context during training, they remain static\\nat test time, limiting their ability to dynamically adapt specifically to the observed\\nscene. To overcome these limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach\\nthat leverages context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address\\nvision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively\\ninitializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image context\\nand further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding to reason\\nabout semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results show that our\\napproach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic metrics PQ† and\\nPQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and achieves a runtime reduc-\\ntion exceeding 14×. Furthermore, our ablation studies reveal that dynamically\\nderiving instance proposals from image context, as opposed to random initializa-\\ntion, leads to a 3.62 %increase in PQ-All and a remarkable average improvement\\nof 18.65 %in combined Thing-metrics. These results underscore the effectiveness\\nof IPFormer and highlight its introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals\\nas a pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.\\n1 Introduction\\nPanoptic scene completion provides a holistic scene understanding that can serve applications like\\nautonomous driving and robotics by reconstructing volumetric geometry from sparse sensor data\\nand assigning meaning to objects in the scene. Such holistic scene understanding requires both\\naccurate geometry and semantic information about a scene. Historically, these tasks have been treated\\nseparately and evolved independently due to the distinct nature of geometric reconstruction and\\nsemantic interpretation, each requiring specialized algorithms and data representations. Despite the\\ninherent interconnection between geometry and semantics, their separation hindered unified scene\\nunderstanding. Classical structure-from-motion evolved into simultaneous localization and mapping\\n(SLAM) systems for accurate reconstructions [36, 12, 25], while deep learning facilitated monocular\\ndepth estimation (MDE) methods [14, 15, 50], which are restricted to visible surfaces. In contrast,\\nscene completion refers to the process of inferring the complete 3D structure of a scene, including\\nboth visible and occluded regions, from partial observations [49, 16].\\n∗Corresponding author: markus.gross@tum.de\\narXiv:2506.20670v1  [cs.CV]  25 Jun 2025\\nMMSearch-R1: Incentivizing LMMs to Search\\nJinming Wu1,∗, Zihao Deng1,∗, Wei Li1, Yiding Liu1, Bo You1,\\nBo Li2,†, Zejun Ma1, Ziwei Liu2\\n1ByteDance 2S-Lab, NTU\\nhttps://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/multimodal-search-r1\\n<reason> The image search results mention the \"Viper\" lunar rover project and a \\nnews article about the cancellation of the project.

First, the\\nhand motion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot’s end-\\neffector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot motion\\ntrajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted motion cap-\\ntures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with plausible robot\\nactions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained generalist diffusion\\npolicy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows the human motion and re-\\nmains within the distribution of plausible robot actions. Our approach avoids the\\nneed for online reinforcement learning or paired human-robot data, enabling ro-\\nbust adaptation to new tasks and scenes with minimal manual effort. Experiments\\nin both simulation and real-world settings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms\\nboth the base policy and the retargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed\\neven on tasks where the pre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.

However, due to the complexity of operating on the encoded ‘logical’\\nqubits [5, 6], understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and\\ncombining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we utilize\\nreconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement all key elements of a universal,\\nfault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working\\nmechanisms. We first employ surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors [6, 7],\\ndemonstrating 2 .14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by\\nleveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding [8, 9]. We then investigate logical\\nentanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery [10–12], and extend it to universal logic\\nthrough transversal teleportation with 3D [[15,1,3]] codes [13, 14], enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis\\nwith logarithmic overhead [5, 15]. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use [16], increasing\\nexperimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens\\nof logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations [17–20] with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]]\\ncodes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments reveal key principles for efficient\\narchitecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic & entropy removal, judiciously\\nusing physical entanglement in logic gates & magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations\\nfor universality & physical qubit reset. These results establish foundations for scalable, universal\\nerror-corrected processing and its practical implementation with neutral atom systems.\\nThe central challenge of quantum computation is its\\ninherent sensitivity to errors [4, 21]. Whereas classical\\ncomputers are composed of intrinsically robust digital\\nbits stabilized by dissipation [22], quantum states are\\nintrinsically analog objects that evolve in a continuous\\nstate space, with coherent unitary evolution that does\\nnot allow dissipation [21]. Remarkably, the discovery of\\nquantum error correction (QEC) [2, 23, 24] provides a\\nmethod to realize robust quantum computation. In this\\napproach, entanglement between many physical qubits is\\nused to encode error-corrected ‘logical’ qubits that can\\nhave exponentially low, digitized errors while performing\\narbitrary, analog-like computations [1, 5].\\nWhile recent experiments provide clear examples\\nwhere QEC works in practice [7, 11, 25], large-scale\\nfault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) remains a\\nformidable challenge. In essence, it requires one to dis-\\nsipatively remove errors from the physical system, while\\nsimultaneously performing arbitrary coherent manipula-\\ntion of the encoded logical qubits. Such operation re-\\nquires a broad range of components [26, 27], coupled\\nwith many important hardware considerations and a\\nwide range of QEC techniques [12, 28–31]. Implement-\\ning and combining these techniques in practical systems,\\nand understanding the scientific principles of resulting\\nfault-tolerant architectures, is a highly complex task at\\nthe frontier of quantum science.\\nHere we experimentally implement the core building\\nblocks for scalable, universal quantum computation and\\nidentify and explore key mechanisms for efficient archi-\\ntectures suitable for deep-circuit FTQC. Utilizing a quan-\\ntum processor based on reconfigurable neutral atom ar-\\nrays and leveraging key hardware upgrades, we study\\nbelow-threshold error correction, fault-tolerant quantum\\noperations, arbitrary unitary synthesis, and physical er-\\nror removal during deep-circuit execution, altogether\\nachieving all ingredients for scalable (i.e., logarithmic\\noverhead) realization of arbitrary quantum algorithms\\n[5].

Such holistic scene understanding requires both\\naccurate geometry and semantic information about a scene. Historically, these tasks have been treated\\nseparately and evolved independently due to the distinct nature of geometric reconstruction and\\nsemantic interpretation, each requiring specialized algorithms and data representations. Despite the\\ninherent interconnection between geometry and semantics, their separation hindered unified scene\\nunderstanding. Classical structure-from-motion evolved into simultaneous localization and mapping\\n(SLAM) systems for accurate reconstructions [36, 12, 25], while deep learning facilitated monocular\\ndepth estimation (MDE) methods [14, 15, 50], which are restricted to visible surfaces.

It allows practitioners to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks while minimizing computational costs compared to traditional full-model fine-tuning methods.\\\\n\\\\n#### 2. **PLoP: Precise LoRA Placement**\\\\nOne of the recent innovations in the LoRA domain is the introduction of **PLoP** (Precise LoRA Placement) by Soufiane Hayou and colleagues. This lightweight method automates the identification of optimal module types where LoRA adapters should be placed within a pretrained model based on the specific fine-tuning task. The research highlights the importance of adapter placement strategy, revealing its significant impact on fine-tuning efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments, PLoP consistently outperforms commonly used strategies and provides new insights into effective module types for LoRA application.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3. **Adapter Placement Strategies**\\\\nThe study on PLoP addresses the underexplored aspect of adapter placement within neural architectures. The traditional approach has been either to use Query and Key modules or MLP modules for LoRA adaptation, but results have been mixed. PLoP offers a theoretically informed and empirically validated solution for selecting the appropriate modules, leading to improved performance in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning tasks. This advance is critical as proper placement may lead to notable efficiency gains in the fine-tuning process.\\\\n\\\\n#### 4. **Impact of LoRA in Fine-tuning Contexts**\\\\nThe application of LoRA has been shown to significantly enhance the adaptability of large models to various tasks without incurring the heavy costs associated with full model training. By strategically placing LoRA adapters, practitioners can achieve faster training times and better performance with lower computational resources. The method not only reinforces the usability of large models but also pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved in model adaptation.\\\\n\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\nRecent advancements in Low-Rank Adaptation, especially with the introduction of automated placement strategies like PLoP, signify an important evolution in the landscape of model fine-tuning. The continued exploration of efficient strategies will enable broader applications for large machine learning models in diverse domains, leading to more agile and responsive AI systems.
